## Guiding Principles

We believe in transparency, less is more, and continuous improvement. We regularly eliminate and simplify policies. Our most important policy is "use your best judgement".
We use tools to enable us empower transparency, for example we prefer using team communications such as [Slack] instead of peer-to-peer communication such as email.
